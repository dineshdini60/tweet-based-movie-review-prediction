# tweet-based-movie-review-prediction
Basic idea is to pull tweets that contain the movie name and predict if people like the movie or not by performing sentimental analysis(NLP) on the tweets.
twitterapi is used to pull the tweets.
A naieve approach to NLP part...i.e sentimental analysis is taken from my other repo :- nlp_sentiment_analysis.
to be optimised......
